			 <p style="color:white"><strong>The BMW Concept 5 Series Gran Turismo of 2009 is a concept car designed by Christopher Weil. It is the first production rendition for BMW's Progressive Activity Sedan (PAS) series of cars and based on the F07 platform.[2] The 5 GT serves as a combination of a sport sedan, an SUV, and a Gran Turismo. The concept was equipped with individual rear seats separated by the center console, whereas the production model has 5 seats. There is an optional extra which includes "executive class seating" eliminating the 5th seat.</strong></p>

			 <p style="color:white"><em>The design is similar in length to the 7 Series, has a height and trunk space that is slightly larger than the 5 Series (E61) wagon, and headroom comparable to the BMW X5.[5] The vehicle has a coupe-like roofline, elevated seating, and a unique "bi-modal" trunk which operates like a sedan or a traditional SUV. For the first time on a 4-door BMW, the 5 Series GT features frameless doors. The headlights contain the new LED Corona rings slanted at an angle and extending into the fenders. The concept is showcased with 21-inch wheels and a new liquid metal styled paintwork called Fluid Cuprite, made specifically for the concept.</em></p>
